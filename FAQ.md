Some commonly asked questions regarding our product.<br>
<br>
<h1>General</h1>

<b>Why the name SyncSharp ?</b>
<br />
We use C#, (<i>pronounced 'C sharp'</i>) as our primary development language, which sounds similar to SyncSharp. Hence the name...<br>
<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>What do you mean by <i>'Plug and sync'</i> ?</b>

We have designed SyncSharp to be used as a general file synchronization tool. Additionally, it is also designed to make <i>computer-to-usb</i> file storage synchronization more convenient.<br>
<br>
Hence, by design, with SyncSharp loaded in your <i>plug and play</i> thumbdrive, with autoplay enabled on your system and your profile set up, our special automatically loaded <i>plug and sync</i> feature will initiate an <i>unattended</i> sync.<br>

<h1>Support</h1>

<b>Is SyncSharp available on mac / linux or other platforms ?</b>
<br />
Currently, SyncSharp is only supported on the Windows platform (2000, XP, Vista and 7). However, if requests use on other popular platforms keeps on increasing, we will try to accommodate and look into it.<br>
<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>I cannot seem to find the installation file?</b>
<br />
<b>:)</b>, that's because unlike most other sync programs out there... SyncSharp needs <b>NO INSTALLATION</b>. You heard it right, its ready to run right out of the box. Just click on on <i>SyncSharp.exe</i> executable to start.<br>
<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>SyncSharp started up by itself when I plugged in my usb drive!</b>
<br />

This feature allows you (with autoplay enabled) to enable automatic startup of synchronization in SyncSharp upon plug in or when you launch SyncSharp. You can vary the countdown time to your liking  (default: 5 secs) and even disable it if you like.<br>

Sync profiles that have been set up earlier will then be automatically performed after countdown has reached zero. At any time before the end of the countdown, you may cancel the planned auto sync.</blockquote>
